                <p>
                    Margherita is a <em>classic Italian pizza</em> that combines both simplicity and bright taste.
        
                    This is a thin-crust pizza pie, a pizza margherita adorned simply in the colors of the Italian flag: green from basil, white from mozzarella, red from tomato sauce.
                            
                    ingredients offer in their proportions what appears to be a kind of austerity — not even 3 ounces of cheese! So, let's see what we will need to bring some Italy to your home

                <h2>Directions</h2>
        
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
                        
                        <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a <strong>large bowl</strong>. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about <strong>5 minutes</strong>.</li>
                        
                        <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes</strong>.</li>
                        
                        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place <strong>(80 to 95 degrees F or 27 to 35 degrees C)</strong> until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
                        
                        <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to <strong>500 degrees F (260 degrees C)</strong>.</li>
                        
                        <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle <strong>10 to 12 inches in diameter</strong>. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place <strong>5 basil leaves on top</strong>. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
                        
                        <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, <strong>5 to 7 minutes</strong>.</li>
